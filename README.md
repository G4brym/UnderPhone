# UnderPhone
This is a very basic Android launcher that will limit the time you spend on your phone by only giving access to a few apps.

This was a 5 hour project, just for fun.

# How to use
1. Install the apk
2. Open the app and set it as your home screen
3. Long press any empty tag to choose an app for that location
